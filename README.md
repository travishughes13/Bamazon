In order to make a purchase, the customer needs to run the file. Once they do, they will be shown the list of products available for purchase, their product IDs, and their price. 

Once the customer makes a selection on the product they would like to purchase, they are prompted to select how many items they would wish to purchase. 

When they make this selection, the product table is updated and the customer is given their total.

After the customer has made the selection, they are given the option to make another purchase of to exit.
